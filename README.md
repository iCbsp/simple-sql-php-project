# simple-sql-php-project
This is a simple project that I use to test stuff using PHP, JavaScript and SQL.

Instructions [Windows]: All files should be placed inside a folder in the htdocs directory. In order to have that htdocs directory, you must install XAMPP first. 
Once the files are inside the folder, you must import the database using PHPMYADMIN with the same name that I used (bd_pruebassql). After that's done it should be good to go.
