# simple-sql-php-project

## Description

This is a simple project that I use to test stuff using PHP, JavaScript and SQL.

## Instructions [Windows]

All files should be placed inside a folder in the htdocs directory. In order to have that htdocs directory, you must install XAMPP first. 

Once the files are inside the folder, you must import the database using PHPMYADMIN with the same name that I used (bd_pruebassql). After that's done it should be good to go.

## Credits

-Images: The credit for the images used is inside the same folder than the pictures.

-Map: The map I used is https://www.openstreetmap.org/. The information to obtain the coordinates is from https://www.latlong.net/.

-Code: I based part of my code in the one I was taught in college, you can find it in http://desarrolloweb.dlsi.ua.es/.
